- Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple pendulum animation using HTML and CSS. The animation simulates a ball hanging from a string that swings back and forth like a pendulum. The key concepts involved include CSS animations, transforms, and keyframes.

- Key Concepts
CSS Animations: CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two main components:

- @keyframes that define the start and end points of the animation as well as any intermediate waypoints.
The animation property that applies the keyframe to an element and defines its behavior.
- Transforms: The transform property in CSS allows you to rotate, scale, move, and skew elements. Transformations are applied to elements to change their appearance and position.

- Transform-Origin: This property allows you to change the position of transformed elements. The transform-origin property is used to change the point around which a transformation is applied.
